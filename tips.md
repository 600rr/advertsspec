# What should I focus on learning?

* CSS animations/transitions/transforms
* Web Performance
* Browser support & vendor prefixes
* NodeJS toolchain
* The JavaScript DOM-api (instead of jQuery)


# Tips for improved performance

* Keep the number of HTTP requests to a minimum
* On the initial load only use JavaScript to add event listeners
* Load the scripts last, so text and images show up while scripts are loading
* When using Web Fonts keep in mind that users might not download the font because of bandwith issues, so make sure the fallback looks good
* For smooth CSS-animations, [only animate position, scale, rotaion and opacity](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/speed/high-performance-animations/)

# What about new APIs and features in browsers?

Technology such as WebGL or new options in CSS can be used, but you must make sure that it has a built in fallback for mobile and legacy browsers.
