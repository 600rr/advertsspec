* Keep the number of HTTP requests to a minimum
* On the initial load only use JavaScript to add event listeners
* When using Web Fonts keep in mind that users might not download the font because of bandwith issues, so make sure the fallback looks good

# What about new APIs and features in browsers?

Technology such as WebGL or new options in CSS can be used, but you must make sure that it has a built in fallback for legacy browsers.
