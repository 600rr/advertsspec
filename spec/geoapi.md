# You can not use the Geo Location APIs

Currently when asked to use the [Geo Location API](http://dev.w3.org/geo/api/spec-source.html) in browsers the user is prompted with a confirmation box saying wether they allow for the Geo Location API to be used for a certain URL. 

Having this pop up for multiple placements on a page is a bad idea and makes for a very bad user experience.
